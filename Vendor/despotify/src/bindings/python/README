About
~~~~~
spytify is a python binding for libdespotify, it uses Cython to create
the bindings, but they're not required to build them (since the .c-files
should be shipped with this README).

The bindings are licensed under the three-clause BSD license, see the
file LICENSE for details.

Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~
 > To build the bindings from .pyx, do make -C src/
 > To build the extension files (from .c), do python setup.py build
   (then do python setup.py install to install them)
