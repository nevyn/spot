Despotify Java Edition.

Based on Jotify by Felix Bruns <felixbruns@web.de>
that was based on the Despotify C edition.

You need Maven 2 in order to build, test and install this project,
which can be downloaded here: http://maven.apache.org/download.html

$ mvn install -Dtest=false

It is however recommended that you do run the tests so you are sure that
the Despotify API actually works. In order to do that you need to set
your account information in src/test/resources/despotify.properties
or pass the VM parameters -Ddespotify.username and -Ddepostify.password

The test cases use a bit of memory, I give it -Xmx1g

The docs is poor but the tests should be an easy study.
